# US-011: Resolve stubs/unimplemented code in src/sefi/store/findings.py

**Status:** unclaimed
**Model:** sonnet
**Component:** store
**Depends On:** None
**Traces To:** (scan-stubs.sh)

## Description

Stub scanner found 2 unimplemented item(s), TODO comment(s), or fake integration(s)
in `src/sefi/store/findings.py`. Review each finding: implement, remove, or convert to a tracked decision.

## Findings

```
  543:        # The `work_units` table is a stub; it is not pre-populated in all
  568:        # Minimal work_units stub so FK references are satisfied when

```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All TODO/FIXME comments resolved or converted to tracked issues
- [ ] No `raise NotImplementedError` in production code paths
- [ ] No stub or fake implementations left in non-test modules
- [ ] No bare ellipsis (`...`) function bodies in production code
- [ ] Tests pass after changes

## Notes

Generated by scan-stubs.sh on 2026-02-17.
Review findings carefully — some may be legitimate (abstract base classes, test helpers).
